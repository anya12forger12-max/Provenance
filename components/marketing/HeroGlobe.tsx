/**
 * The hero globe: the product's own MapLibre engine, its own registry, and its own
 * live layers — not a video of them, and not a curated highlight reel.
 *
 * This deliberately breaks the "the landing page must not load MapLibre" rule the
 * design brief started with. The trade was made on purpose — a real, rotating,
 * live-data globe is a far better argument than a rendered clip, and it makes the
 * closing line ("everything above was this") literally true. It is paid for by
 * mounting on browser idle (see HeroStage.tsx), so the headline still paints on
 * the night stage first and the engine is never on the critical path.
 *
 * EVERY registered signal layer is drawn, not a hand-picked handful. The list
 * arrives as a prop from the server (page.tsx reads `SOURCE_CATALOG`, which is
 * itself computed from `SIGNALS`) rather than being imported here, because
 * importing the registry into a client component would drag all ~39 adapter
 * modules into the browser bundle to read four strings off each of them. Adding an
 * adapter therefore adds a layer to this globe with no edit to this file — the same
 * property the source wall and the ledger further down the page have.
 *
 * RENDERING follows WorldMap exactly: THREE aggregated sources (points, lines,
 * fills) with colour driven off each feature's own props, rather than one source
 * and one layer per signal. Thirty-nine sources and thirty-nine layers would cost
 * a style recompile per feed that lands, on the first screen of the site.
 *
 * FRAMING. The container is a square of the sphere's own diameter, parked by CSS
 * so its centre sits below the fold — so the globe reads as rising into the hero
 * rather than sitting in a box. See `zoomToFill`.

/**
 * The zoom at which MapLibre's globe very nearly fills a SQUARE box `px` across.
 *
 * `GLOBE_FIT_PX` is a calibration constant, not a derivation. The tempting
 * derivation — the Mercator world is 512·2^z px wide, so the sphere is that over
 * π — gives 163 and is wrong: MapLibre renders the globe through a perspective
 * camera, so apparent diameter is not linear in 2^z and no closed form survives a
 * range of zooms. What IS stable is that this formula produces the same FILL
 * RATIO at every size, because the container is always square and so the camera's
 * framing never changes. Measured off the painted WebGL buffer:
 *
 *     C = 163  ->  fill 0.779 at 390px, 1440px and 1920px wide
 *     C = 127  ->  fill 0.948 at 390px, 1440px and 1920px wide
 *
 * 127 is deliberately the value that lands just UNDER a perfect fit. Overshooting
 * is not a near miss: the sphere would be clipped by its own box and the limb
 * would come back as a straight vertical edge down the hero, which is far worse
 * than a few pixels of starfield. This only holds while the box is square — if
 * that changes, recalibrate rather than nudging the number.
 *
 * `verify-provenance.mjs` measures the fill ratio, so a MapLibre upgrade that
 * moves it fails the gate instead of quietly reframing the hero.
