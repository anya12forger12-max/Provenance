// Replaces the old two-engine renderer (react-globe.gl GlobeView + MapLibre
// MapView, cross-faded by altitude). MapLibre v5 morphs a spinning 3D globe
// (zoomed out) into a flat street/satellite map (zoomed in) in a single canvas —
// continuous Google-Earth zoom, no cross-fade seam. Every live layer (cameras,
// planes + trails, satellites) is a MapLibre source/layer on this one map.
//
// Identity: calm + light. CARTO Positron is the default basemap; the globe is
// the hero; progressive disclosure keeps it from being dot-soup (cameras are a
// few soft glows far out, materialising into detailed icons on descent).

// The reason there is ONE resolver rather than a patch per call site is measured,
// not stylistic. At z13 over central London the map draws 97 individual camera pins
// and 24 live-thumbnail buttons; the buttons stopPropagation (liveThumbnails.ts:58)
// so they never reach the layer handler, and which of the two a given camera gets
// depends on MAX_THUMBS and on `available`. Two code paths that can disagree about
// what an armed click means would disagree for 24 cameras out of 97, side by side,
// at the same zoom — a bug no manual click-test would reliably find.
